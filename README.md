# RDBMS-for-AirBnB
Relational Database Management System for AirBnB

## Focus
The project focus is to understand how AirBnB (as an online marketplace offering homestays) utilizes a digital platform with their Database and Relational Database Management System model to manage its property listings and stakeholders (Guest and Host only in this case).
The objective of the project is to analyze the data and information about AirBnB and develop a relational database model that serves as part of its data repository.

## Technique
Through our design, we aim to device a scalable database by designing a prototype RDBMS for city of San Francisco, California, USA that can be expanded/scaled further in a similar fashion into states and even countries to cover AirBnB's area of presence.
The project is constructed using Lucidchart for initial ERD and MySQL Workbench database software and wherein SQL queries are employed performing the tasks of building tables, loading data into them and data retrieval queries (using condition, sorting, grouping, multi-table queries, sub-queries etc).

## Analysis and Result
Through this data repository, we explore how AirBnB can enable both Hosts and Guests to make informed, data-backed decisions for interaction choices in both online and offline world and also track their organizationâ€™s periodic and overall performance.

The Presentation and Report summarizes the project in stagewise manner including description of organization, area focus, need, entities and attributes, relevant business rules, normalization process, SQL queries and results, benefits and challenges faced during the project.
